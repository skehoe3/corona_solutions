# corona_solutions
The project was created as part of the Data Natives #hackcorona event, March 22, 2020.

The goal of this repository is to help people who find themselves without work occupy their time and potentially make money.  To that end, we created a Google Form for employers who need help, and another one for people who need work.  The form data is saved to a Google sheet, which our system then requests data from via an API call.  Finally, we match employees to employers based on time availability and the skills needed.
